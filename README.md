This project showcases the automated provisioning and configuration of a scalable multi-VM infrastructure using Vagrant, VirtualBox, and Ansible. A central control node (Ansible host) manages two slave nodes (web servers) to install essential services, deploy a dynamic webpage, and control the state of background services. The project automates end-to-end environment setup—from VM creation and SSH configuration to software deployment and service orchestration—making it an ideal DevOps use case for infrastructure-as-code and system configuration management.
